# Project Overview <br/>
• Analyzed FDIC bank closure data (2001–2023) to compare the frequency of failures with the magnitude of financial losses. <br/>
• Merged multiple FDIC datasets, constructing a final dataset of 547 records across 14 variables, including geographic, financial, and timeline attributes. <br/>
• Conducted statistical analysis and created visualizations in RStudio, refining them with Adobe Illustrator for presentation. <br/>
• Presented findings at iSchool’s Poster Day 2024, showcasing insights on the implications of bank failure patterns. <br/>
